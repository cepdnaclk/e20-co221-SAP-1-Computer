# SAP1 Computer Design Project


Welcome to the SAP1(simple As Possible 1) Computer Project repository! This project was developed as part of the CO221(Degital Designing) course at Department of Computer Engineering - University of Peradeniya. The SAP1 computer is a minimalist computer architecture designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of digital logic and computer organization.


### Project Description
This repository contains all the necessary files, documentation, and code for building and simulating the SAP1 computer. From the basic architecture design to the implementation of individual components such as the instruction register, arithmetic logic unit (ALU), memory, and control unit, etc. This project provides a comprehensive exploration of computer organization principles.
